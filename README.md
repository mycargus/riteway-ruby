# The RITEway Ruby gem

Simple, readable, helpful unit tests in Ruby. Inspired by Eric Elliott's
[RITEway].

- **R**eadable
- **I**solated/**I**ntegrated
- **T**horough
- **E**xplicit

RITEway forces you to write **R**eadable, **I**solated, and **E**xplicit tests,
because that's the only way you can use the API. It also makes it easier to be
**T**horough by making test assertions so simple that you'll want to write more
of them.

There are [5 questions every unit test must answer]. RITEway forces you to
answer them.

1. What is the unit under test (module, method, class, whatever)?
2. What should it do? (Prose description)
3. What was the actual output?
4. What was the expected output?
5. How do you reproduce the failure?
